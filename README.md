## Abstract
This study analyzes how soccer players' speed magnitude and angle change based on their proximity to the ball and the game phases (defensive and attacking). Player roles strongly influence speed patterns. Generally, speed increases as players approach the ball but slightly decreases upon reaching it. The angle of speed relative to the ball direction varies with distance and game phase. Goalkeepers tend to run parallel to the ball during defense, while forwards move more directly toward it. This behavior shifts significantly during attacking phases. The methodology presented allows for analyzing speed-angle patterns to better understand player movements relative to ball distance.
